Q3. 

Single-table Style Mapping: 

R would have these tuple values:
    a is NOT null, b is NOT null, c is null, d is null

S would have these tuple values: 
    a is NOT null, b is null, c is NOT null, d is null


------- Reagarding Assignment 1 -------
If you have nested select statements in your assignment, 
split them up like below: 
    select  * 
    from    R
    where   R.a in (
                        select  * 
                        from    S 
                        where   S.b > 10;
                    );
