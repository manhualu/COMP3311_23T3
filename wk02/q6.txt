Similarity: A researcher can work on zero or more Projects, a Project can be worked on by ONE or more Researchers, 


Difference: the time attribute is in different places.

Diagram a) Time attribute is on the relationship.
Time would be specific to the amount of time a Researcher worked on a Project.
e.g.  
John works on Project1 for 10hrs.
John works on Project2 for 2hrs.
Mary works on Project1 for 5hrs.


Diagram b) Time attribute is ONLY on the Project entity. 
Time would be specific only to the Project itself, the time is not specific to how much time a Researcher worked on a Project. 
e.g. 
(based on above example)
Project1 has been worked on for 15hrs (10 + 5).
Project2 has been worked on for 2hrs.
